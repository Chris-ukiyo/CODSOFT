The dataset includes:
- `Title`: Movie title
- `Genre`: Genre of the movie
- `Director`: Director's name
- `Actors`: List of actors
- `Rating`: Movie rating (target variable)
- `Release Date`: Release date of the movie

## Modeling Techniques
- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (encoding categorical variables)
- Regression modeling techniques (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset, with visualizations illustrating the relationships between features and ratings.
